**0-main.c** - This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.<br/><br/>
**1-main.c** - Copy this main file. comment out (don't delete it!) the part that of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.<br/><br/>
**2-largest_number.c** - Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.<br/><br/>
